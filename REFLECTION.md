 ### What patterns or surprises did you notice?
Once I had a structure down for each function, and the method to push it to github memorized, it sped up the process significantly.  

### What logic challenged your thinking?
None of the logics challenged my thinking too much.

### How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?
"Toolkits" like this can be part of larg codes where functions get reused.
